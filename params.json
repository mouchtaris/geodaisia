The input for the\r\nprogram is a list of points, along with their coordinates and their\r\nsupposed height. The output is an SVG file which describes/draws these\r\npoints, as well as the equal-height lines among them.\r\n\r\nThis is an experimental/hobby project and the result is not\r\nquite satisfactory yet. Yet, it is well-maintained, and the\r\narchitecture is quite good as a starting point.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\nThis project depends on JScience for some very basic features, like\r\n`LargeNumber` support. The list of jscience usages can be tracked through\r\nthe [find_jscience_usages.sh](https://github.com/mouchtaris/geodaisia/blob/master/scripts/find_jscience_usages.sh)\r\nscript.\r\n\r\n## Sample output\r\nThis is a sample output for some input of points and their \"height\":\r\n<img src=\"tostsvg.svgz\" />","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
